## Main Core Subsystems

In Play Mode you can control a Tank and shoot bullets.

Tank Controls:
- W --> Move forward
- A --> Rotate left
- S --> Move backwards
- D --> Rotate right
- Mouse Movement --> Aim Shoot
- Right Click --> Shoot

The Tank moves and rotates with keyboard controls and the turret rotates with the mouse.

When Play Mode stops the Tank positions resets.

The Bullets are game objects with a life time.

When a bullet is created, a text appears in the Console window.

The script variables of the tank are modifiable in the Inspector window.
